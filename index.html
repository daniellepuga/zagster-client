        ABOUT: Using the Herokuapp website, we imported data from a Zagster database and utilized the Chart.js library to output the data in a
        visually appealing format. Data was taken from the website in an array format, converted to 
        the correct format, and appropriately labeled & added to our chart. Labels were added in our chart to improve readability
        and make a clear division in months for all of 2017.
